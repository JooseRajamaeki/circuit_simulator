# circuit_simulator
A simple simulator that solves voltages in a passive element network using the nodal admittance matrix method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_admittance_matrix).

The files are header files that contain templates for the used classes. There is also the C++-file "main_test.cpp" that demonstrates and tests the usage. 

The project depends on linear algebra library Eigen (eigen.tuxfamily.org) that is not included in the repository.
